<h2>Striker takes goal tally against Leicester City to 16 as 3-0 defeat hits Foxes' top-four ambitions</h2><br><br>
Harry Kane scored two goals in three minutes as Tottenham Hotspur beat Leicester City 3-0 to boost their hopes of European football 
next season while putting the Foxes' top-four ambitions in the balance.<p>
Spurs went ahead when Son Heung-min’s shot deflected in off James Justin in the sixth minute.<p>
Kane struck in the 37th minute, sliding home a pass from Lucas Moura.<p>
The pair combined again three minutes later, when Moura found his team-mate on the left and 
Kane curled in a superb shot for his 16th goal against Leicester in all competitions.<p>
Leicester dominated the second half but could not find a goal and so remain in fourth, 
only above Manchester United on goals scored.<p>
Spurs rise to sixth on 58 points. <br><br>
