<h2>Southampton striker scores 21st goal of season but misses penalty in 2-0 win over relegation-threatened Cherries</h2><br><br>
Danny Ings scored his 21st Premier League goal of the season as Southampton's 2-0 win 
at AFC Bournemouth pushed the Cherries closer towards relegation.<p>
The striker opened the scoring four minutes before half-time, from Nathan Redmond’s pass.<p>
Ings had a chance to reduce the gap to Jamie Vardy in the Golden Boot race to a single goal 
in the 56th minute but saw his penalty saved by Aaron Ramsdale.<p>
AFC Bournemouth pressed for an equaliser and in stoppage time Sam Surridge thought he had scored, <p>
but VAR overturned his goal for offside against Callum Wilson in the build-up.<p>
There was still time for Che Adams to seal Saints' win with a strike that drops AFC Bournemouth 
below Aston Villa on goals scored to 19th.<p>
They have 31 points and will be relegated if Watford avoid defeat at home to Manchester City on Tuesday.<p>
Southampton rise to 11th on 49 points.<br><br>
